# React and PHP chat

I was designing a protocl to make a real time communication between a server and many clients in order to implement a online playing version of tic tac toe. To test the protocol I designed this little chat. Some important features are:

- Individual and general rooms.
- Unread messages notification.
- Client disconnection notification.
- "Typing..." message to let you know the other person is active
